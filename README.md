# p5play doll game demo

This is the code for the demo game shown here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fWStxYepE0>

Try it out here: <https://fsudigitalmedia.github.io/p5play_dolldemo/>

It uses my [p5play_template repo](https://github.com/FSUdigitalmedia/p5play_template), which requres the following libraries:

* [p5 & p5.sound](https://p5js.org/download/)
* [p5play & planck](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/p5play)

See the links for license information.

## Notes

If you want to include sound, be sure to uncomment the line in `index.html` that includes the `p5.sound` library.
